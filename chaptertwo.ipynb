Rivers are often regarded, and ideally also function, as highways for biodiversity and wildlife through urban and periurban spaces. In addition to the river itself, the banks of the river often play host to diverse environments and semi wild plants where insects, fungus and small animals can find refuge and move throughout the urbanized region.\n"
