    "There are a wide range of germination conditions for regional wildflowers, information on which is often not readily available. This simple experiment will test which species germinate under the simple conditions of being kept moist, at 20 degrees celsius, and exposed to the moderate light from a large easterly facing window and typical houselamps. Information on the seeds storage and age will be taken into account and this information will form the basis of an open source germination requirements database of the regional flora."

    "This experiment attemps to answer the question of whether a given amount of seeds yields \"no germination\" \"low germination\", \"moderate germination\" and \"high germination.\" It was decided to keep the recording methodology simple to maxmiize the number of samples that could be sprouted and succesfully kept moist and absorbed. For species with a clearly high germination rate under these conditions, they will be noted, the seedlings transferred to an unheated greenhouse to weather the winter and used for the next year. For the others, the onset of winter will be used to stratify the seeds for one month. This will be detailed in the \"next steps\" section.\n",

    "#### Choice of seeds\n",
    "\n",
    "The seeds chosen for germination come from my personal collection, gathered in 2020 or 2021, or from Equipe Volo. I gathered seeds either in Biel/Bienne, in La Chaux-de-Fonds, and in one case, from an alpage in the Jura near Biel/Bienne, Pr√©s-la-Patte. The seeds from Equipe Volo came from samples of their seed inventory as well as a collection of old seeds considered invalid. Some of the seeds from Volo are missing location identifiers. I germinated as many as I could reasonably manage and will continue to germinate seeds over the next months until readily available seeds are no longer available.\n"
