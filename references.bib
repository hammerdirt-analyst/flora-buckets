This is especially true for rare species, which are typically assessed on the basis of expert judgment rather than data. Revisiting previously assessed populations enables estimation of local extinction rates and the identification of species characteristics and habitats with high local extinction risk. Between 2010 and 2016, in a nationwide revisitation study, 420 volunteer botanists revisited 8,024 populations of the 713 rarest and most threatened plant species in Switzerland recorded between 1960 and 2001. Of the revisited 8,024 populations, 27% had gone locally extinct. Among critically endangered species, the local extinctions increased to 40%. Species from ruderal and freshwater habitat types showed the highest proportion of local extinctions. Our results provide compelling evidence for rapid and widespread local extinctions and suggest that current conservation measures are insufficient. Local extinctions precede and provide early warnings for global extinctions. The ongoing loss of populations suggests that we will lose species diversity unless we scale up species-targeted conservation and restoration measures, especially in anthropogenic landscapes.},

	abstract = {The ongoing sixth mass extinction may be the most serious environmental threat to the persistence of civilization, because it is irreversible. Thousands of populations of critically endangered vertebrate animal species have been lost in a century, indicating that the sixth mass extinction is human caused and accelerating. The acceleration of the extinction crisis is certain because of the still fast growth in human numbers and consumption rates. In addition, species are links in ecosystems, and, as they fall out, the species they interact with are likely to go also. In the regions where disappearing species are concentrated, regional biodiversity collapses are likely occurring. Our results reemphasize the extreme urgency of taking massive global actions to save humanity{\textquoteright}s crucial life-support systems.The ongoing sixth mass species extinction is the result of the destruction of component populations leading to eventual extirpation of entire species. Populations and species extinctions have severe implications for society through the degradation of ecosystem services. Here we assess the extinction crisis from a different perspective. We examine 29,400 species of terrestrial vertebrates, and determine which are on the brink of extinction because they have fewer than 1,000 individuals. There are 515 species on the brink (1.7\% of the evaluated vertebrates). Around 94\% of the populations of 77 mammal and bird species on the brink have been lost in the last century. Assuming all species on the brink have similar trends, more than 237,000 populations of those species have vanished since 1900. We conclude the human-caused sixth mass extinction is likely accelerating for several reasons. First, many of the species that have been driven to the brink will likely become extinct soon. Second, the distribution of those species highly coincides with hundreds of other endangered species, surviving in regions with high human impacts, suggesting ongoing regional biodiversity collapses. Third, close ecological interactions of species on the brink tend to move other species toward annihilation when they disappear{\textemdash}extinction breeds extinctions. Finally, human pressures on the biosphere are growing rapidly, and a recent example is the current coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, linked to wildlife trade. Our results reemphasize the extreme urgency of taking much-expanded worldwide actions to save wild species and humanity{\textquoteright}s crucial life-support systems from this existential threat.},

	abstract = {We review changes in the status of butterflies in Europe, focusing on long-running population data available for the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Belgium, based on standardized monitoring transects. In the United Kingdom, 8\% of resident species have become extinct, and since 1976 overall numbers declined by around 50\%. In the Netherlands, 20\% of species have become extinct, and since 1990 overall numbers in the country declined by 50\%. Distribution trends showed that butterfly distributions began decreasing long ago, and between 1890 and 1940, distributions declined by 80\%. In Flanders (Belgium), 20 butterflies have become extinct (29\%), and between 1992 and 2007 overall numbers declined by around 30\%. A European Grassland Butterfly Indicator from 16 European countries shows there has been a 39\% decline of grassland butterflies since 1990. The 2010 Red List of European butterflies listed 38 of the 482 European species (8\%) as threatened and 44 species (10\%) as near threatened (note that 47 species were not assessed). A country level analysis indicates that the average Red List rating is highest in central and mid-Western Europe and lowest in the far north of Europe and around the Mediterranean. The causes of the decline of butterflies are thought to be similar in most countries, mainly habitat loss and degradation and chemical pollution. Climate change is allowing many species to spread northward while bringing new threats to susceptible species. We describe examples of possible conservation solutions and a summary of policy changes needed to conserve butterflies and other insects.Data on the Red List statuses of butterflies in the different European countries (94) have been deposited in Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), https://doi.org/10.15468/ye7whj.

	abstract = {Major declines in insect biomass and diversity, reviewed here, have become obvious and well documented since the end of World War II. Here, we conclude that the spread and intensification of agriculture during the past half century is directly related to these losses. In addition, many areas, including tropical mountains, are suffering serious losses because of climate change as well. Crops currently occupy about 11\% of the world{\textquoteright}s land surface, with active grazing taking place over an additional 30\%. The industrialization of agriculture during the second half of the 20th century involved farming on greatly expanded scales, monoculturing, the application of increasing amounts of pesticides and fertilizers, and the elimination of interspersed hedgerows and other wildlife habitat fragments, all practices that are destructive to insect and other biodiversity in and near the fields. Some of the insects that we are destroying, including pollinators and predators of crop pests, are directly beneficial to the crops. In the tropics generally, natural vegetation is being destroyed rapidly and often replaced with export crops such as oil palm and soybeans. To mitigate the effects of the Sixth Mass Extinction event that we have caused and are experiencing now, the following will be necessary: a stable (and almost certainly lower) human population, sustainable levels of consumption, and social justice that empowers the less wealthy people and nations of the world, where the vast majority of us live, will be necessary.There are no data underlying this work.},

Most of previous studies have been performed at single sites, or were spatially restricted at the landscape level. In this study, we analyse trends of species richness and shifts in species composition of butterflies and burnet moth species across the federal state of Baden-Württemberg in south-western Germany, covering an area of 35,750 km2. The data set consists of 233,474 records and covers a period from 1750 until today. We grouped species according to their species´ specific functional traits and analyse how species with different habitat requirements and behaviour respond to land-use changes over time. Our data document a significant loss of relative abundance for most species, especially since the 1950s until today. Species demanding specific habitat requirements are more seriously suffering under this trend than generalists. This in particular affects taxa adapted to extensively used xerothermic grasslands, bogs or other habitats maintained by traditional low-productivity agricultural practices of the past. Our data indicate large-scale decline in relative abundance of many butterfly and burnet moth species, which happened in particular during the past few decades.},

This article reviews the observed impacts of climate change on biodiversity and considers some perspectives for the future at the national level. The following impacts are already evident for all considered taxonomic groups: elevation shifts of distribution towards mountain summits, spread of thermophilous species, colonisation by new species from warmer areas and phenological shifts. Additionally, in the driest areas, increasing droughts are affecting tree survival and fish species are suffering from warm temperatures in lowland regions. These observations are coherent with model projections, and future changes will probably follow the current trends. These changes will likely cause extinctions for alpine species (competition, loss of habitat) and lowland species (temperature or drought stress). In the very urbanised Swiss landscape, the high fragmentation of the natural ecosystems will hinder the dispersal of many species towards mountains. Moreover, disruptions in species interactions caused by individual migration rates or phenological shifts are likely to have consequences for biodiversity. Conversely, the inertia of the ecosystems (species longevity, restricted dispersal) and the local persistence of populations will probably result in lower extinction rates than expected with some models, at least in 21st century. It is thus very difficult to estimate the impact of climate change in terms of species extinctions. A greater recognition by society of the intrinsic value of biodiversity and of its importance for our existence will be essential to put in place effective mitigation measures and to safeguard a maximum number of native species.}

Road verges offer potential alternative habitats for meadow species, but they may not be suitable for all meadow species due to different soil properties, frequent disturbances, pollution or suboptimal management. Are their communities of vascular plants and bryophytes similar or dissimilar to those in mown or grazed meadows? What kind of species are associated with road verges, mown meadows or grazed meadows? How do the habitat types differ in their soil conditions and disturbance intensity? Location The study was conducted at 36 sites in central Finland. Methods We compared the vascular plant and bryophyte flora and the habitat characteristics of road verges, mown meadows and grazed meadows. Results The community composition of both vascular plants and bryophytes differed among the habitat types. Many species occurred in all three habitat types, but several meadow specialists were absent or less frequent in the road verges. In contrast, road verges hosted more forest species and ruderal species, especially bryophytes. Road verges differed from meadows in their soil conditions. Conclusions We conclude that although road verges may host some species typical to meadows, their value as alternative habitats could be increased by improved soil preparation and vegetation management. Meanwhile, the continued decline of quality habitats for meadow species underscores the need to maintain, increase and improve meadow management.},

The impact of intentional wildflower plantings on remnant native plant diversity in urban and peri-urban settings has not received attention, although shared pollinators are likely to mediate several types of biotic interactions between human-introduced plants and remnant native ones. Additionally, if wildflower species escape gardens these indirect effects may be compounded with direct ones. We review the potential positive and negative impacts of wildflower gardens on urban native flowering plants, and we reveal substantial gaps in our knowledge. We present a roadmap for research to address whether wildflower gardens, while benefiting pollinators, could also hasten the extinction of native remnant plants in urban settings, or whether they could have other effects that enrich urban biodiversity. Goals of future wildflower mixes should consider the totality of potential interactions.},

abstract = {Summary 1. Seed mixtures of wildflowers are used increasingly in schemes to restore biodiversity in intensively managed farmland. Usually, the seed mixtures are produced by commercial suppliers and they may be distributed over large geographical distances. It is therefore important to ask what problems may arise from using seed that is not of local origin. The aim of this study was to evaluate one potential problem, namely the effects of genetic introgression of foreign provenances on the fitness of local weed populations. 2. The problem was investigated using the arable weed species Agrostemma githago, Papaver rhoeas and Silene alba, all of which are commonly included in commercial seed mixtures in Switzerland. Hybrids (F1 and F2 backcrosses) were made between local Swiss plants and plants of English, German and Hungarian provenance (plus F1 from one US source in Silene). In a field experiment the growth of the hybrid plants was compared with that of the parents. Above-ground dry matter after one growing season was taken as a measure of fitness. Additionally, survivorship and seed mass were determined for some of the hybrids. 3. The biomass data revealed negative outbreeding effects caused by epistasis in all four F2 backcrosses of Papaver and in the F2 of Agrostemma hybridized with plants of German provenance; no such effects were found in Silene. Survival was slightly lower in the F1 hybrids of Papaver, and considerably reduced in the F2 backcrosses. For Silene, a heterosis effect was evident in seed mass in the F1 generation, while seed mass decreased in the F2. The same trend, although less strong, was also observed in Agrostemma. 4. The results suggest that only plants of relatively local origin should be used in wildflower mixtures, although it is not possible to specify precisely over what distance seed can safely be transferred. The same recommendation is also valid for schemes to reinvigorate endangered plant populations. The relevance of the fitness components that were measured, and the long-term effects of genetic introgressions, are discussed.},

abstract = {Urban areas are species-rich ecosystems. The question remains, however, whether urban species constitute a unique community, and thus add value to landscape biodiversity, or whether they are just a mixture of species from surrounding ecosystems. In this study, the occurrence and abundance of arthropods were analysed according to trophic guilds (Cerambycidae and Buprestidae as xylophagous species, Apiformes as pollinators, Neuroptera as flying predators, Araneae and Carabidae as surface-dwelling predators) in urban, agricultural and forest ecosystems in Switzerland. To assess the likely origin of arthropod fauna in Swiss cities, we identified character species (regular and constant occurrence) for ecosystems and performed ordination and cluster analyses. In total, we studied 10,034 specimens from 497 species and found that 13% of all species and 10% of the character species were predominately found in the urban ecosystems. Community analyses showed that the three ecosystems harbour distinct species assemblages. While communities at forest sites are quite dissimilar from those at urban and agricultural sites, these latter share more than one third of all character species, which indicates either that agricultural areas function as source habitats for urban communities or that agricultural species have survived urbanisation in situ. Overall, our study identified a distinct urban arthropod community that enriches landscape (gamma) diversity in Switzerland. Urban sites may provide novel habitats for species of former extensive agriculture, or species otherwise not, or scarcely, occurring in the region. The present study illuminates the value of urban arthropods for overall biodiversity which should be incorporated in planning decisions.}

abstract = {Wildflower strips (WFS) are increasingly commonly adopted measures to promote biodiversity in agro-ecosystems. While their effectiveness in providing floral and other food resources for pollinators and natural enemies has been relatively well studied, much less is known about the value of different types of WFS as overwintering habitat for different functional arthropod groups. Here, we examined arthropod overwintering in WFS of different age compared to winter wheat fields. Moreover, we addressed the largely unexplored question to what extent non-permanent WFS may act as sink or ecological trap, if they attract high numbers of overwintering arthropods but only a low proportion of them survive and successfully emerge due to ploughing of strips during overwintering. Overwintering of all studied arthropod groups including potential pest natural enemies spiders, carabid beetles, staphylinid beetles and different families of pollinating flies was higher in WFS compared to winter wheat crops. Overwintering increased in WFS compared to wheat fields irrespective of WFS age, except for 4 year old WFS in the case of carabid beetles and 1 year old WFS in the case of spiders. While WFS age positively affected spider overwintering, numbers of overwintering pollinating flies and staphylinid beetles did not change significantly with WFS age. Moreover, carabid beetles tended to decline in the four years old WFS compared to younger ones. Ploughing of annual WFS during overwintering significantly reduced the number of successfully emerging arthropods by 59% on average. Detrimental effects were strongest for carabid beetles and spiders (reductions by 67% and 69%, respectively) to their numbers in ploughed WFS being similar to winter wheat fields. Reductions were less severe for pollinating flies and staphylinid beetles (both 47%), with higher numbers emerging from annual WFS compared to winter wheat fields even after ploughing of WFS. We conclude that perennial WFS are valuable overwintering habitats for a range of arthropod taxa across functional groups in arable cropping systems. Distinct responses of different arthropod taxa to WFS age highlight the importance of managing perennial WFS of various successional stages in order to promote overwintering of a broad variety arthropods in agro-ecosystems. Our study raises concerns, however, that annual WFS ploughed during the overwintering period are poor overwintering habitats for arthropods and may even act as ecological traps.}
