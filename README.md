# The Biodiversity Box

A Biodiversity Box is a portable biotope composed of 100% native flowers sourced locally and custom built to reflect the unique biogeography of the Seeland region.

This repository builds the Jupyter Book (files stored under /docs), available through the following dedicated link: https://thorerismann.github.io/hdbot/

The Jupyter Book is divided into the following sections:
* Part 1 (intro.md) provides the landing page.
* Part 2 (intro-context.ipynb) provides a short introduction to the dire situation facing biodiversity locally and globally.
* Part 3 (surveys.ipynb) summarizes the results of nearly 5000 vascular plant observations made in Biel between 2020 and 2021.
* Part 4 (flora-buckets.ipynb) presents the biodiversity boxes concept.
* Part 5 (germination.ipynb) presents a germination experiment with 90 different seeds of different characteristics.
* Part 6 (resources.ipynb) concludes this report, proposes next steps and acknowledges key regional and national resources.

In addition to the usual files, the remainder of the repository is structured as follows:
* The preprocess.ipynb file prepares the data from the surveys and the germination experiment for use.
* The /resources folder stores all of the data and reference files used in this analysis. A list of references used is available in the bibliography. Links to download the reference files used are available in the resources.ipynb file.
* Many source files are stored locally and regularly modified with the results exported to a .csv format in the /resources folder.

This page is under development and the final version will be frozen around December 2021. It will thus likely have been updated since the last time you visited. A French and German translation will be available soon.
