The biodiversity crisis is coming home and now is the time for innovative, efficient and scientifically rigorous solutions that meet specific local needs in a scalable framework. Biel/Bienne and the surrounding region is blessed with unique local flora adapted to the regional conditions - unfortunately the genetic pool of some 60% of vascular plant species in the Central Plateau are threatened to one degree or another. This project pilots two intertwined solutions to this problem. 

First, we surveyed vascular plants throughout the city of Biel/Bienne and its immediate surroundings. These surveys are designed to quickly identify biodiversity hotspots and provide an overview of the situation on a street by street level. This data is integrated into the national databases maintained by InfoFlora and then used to develop templates for city-wide and site-specific feedback for both renaturalization projects and general greenspace management by the city and other regional actors. This data product forms the first part of the solution by offering regional managers a tool to evaluate the quality of vascular plant diversity with useable, custom reports that can also be used by researchers and civil society. Further, this data will be combined with phytoassociative data to provide managers with site specific reccomendations on the species that should be planted, or at least encouraged so that the once rich rudderal habitats can again house a great deal of biodiversity in close proximity to human activities.

Building off the survey results, we developed biodiversity boxes to offer portable patches of nature composed of 100% native flowers sourced locally and conceived to reflect the unique biogeography around Biel/Bienne. These boxes will be offered to businesses, public authorities and private consumers as an alternative to the non-sustainable commercial horticultural products that unfortunately still dominate the local market. As a part of building conservation capacity, we will experiment with growing different wildflowers, especially those that are not available for purchase regionally, or in general. As the biodiversity boxes are developed, we will make the germination and growth data available to all - this is too important to remain a commercial secret.

By spending time in the field collecting seed and conducting surveys, we ensure that our biodiversity boxes are not only *truly* reflective of the local biodiversity on a species level but offer opportunities to continually collect seed and cuttings throughout the year and region to promulgate diversity on the level of genetics - rather than claim a superficial increase in biodiversity while overwhelming the local flora with commercial imports from ZÃ¼rich at best, and Holland at worst.

This report briefly reviews the context of biodiversity loss, presents the Biel/Bienne plant surveys and the biodiversity boxes and premium plant patches concept.

* Part 1 (intro-context.ipynb) provides a short overview to the problem of biodiversity loss on the level of habitat, species and genetics.
* Part 2 (surveys.ipynb) summarizes the results of the two survey projects run in 2020 and in 2021 and provides the framework for the 2022 surveys.
* Part 3 (flora-buckets.ipynb) presents the biodiversity boxes concept in more detail and establishes the current market gap for regional source-verified seeds and seedlings.
* Part 4 (resources.ipynb) concludes this report, proposes next steps and acknowledges key regional and national resources.
