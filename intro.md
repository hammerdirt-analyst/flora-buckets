A Biodiversity Box is a portable biotope composed of 100% native flowers sourced locally and conceived to reflect the unique biogeography of the Seeland region. This report provides the background for these boxes and is divided into the following sections:

* Part 1 (intro-context.ipynb) provides a short introduction to the dire situation facing biodiversity globally, and also in the region around Biel/Bienne. 
* Part 2 (surveys.ipynb) summarizes the results of some 6000 vascular plant observations made in the metropolitan region of Biel between 2020 and 2021.
* Part 3 (flora-buckets.ipynb) presents the biodiversity boxes concept in more detail.
* Part 4 (germination.ipynb) presents the results of a wild flower germination experiment.
* Part 5 (resources.ipynb) concludes this report, proposes next steps and acknowledges key regional and national resources.
